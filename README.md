# Genetic Algorithm Demonstration
###### Curteosy of Professor M. Franklin KSU

This program demonstrates the genetic algorithm to maximize our function <code>f(x) = x<sup>2</sup></code>.
We do this in a series of 5 steps:

 1 - Randomly generate candidates
 
 2 - Apply fitness function & sort
 
 3 - Crossover
 
 4 - Mutate
 
 5 - Repeat
 
These steps give us the ability to find optimized solutions to difficult problems when we donâ€™t know the exact answer.
This program uses bitstrings as candidates. Of course we can know by looking that a candidate bitstring of 11111
(given a max bitstring length of 5) would maximize our fitness function <code>f(x) = x<sup>2</sup></code>, because `11111` (31 in decimal) is `f(31) = 961`.
However this program is meant to show the procedure of the GA and provide any reference necessary.
